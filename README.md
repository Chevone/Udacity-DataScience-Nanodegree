# Data Science Nanodegree Repository

## Description
"Data scientists interpret, extrapolate from, and prescribe from data to deliver actionable recommendations."
- [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)

## Important files and Notes
The Data Science Nanodegree is split into 6 sections each with their own lecture materials and projects:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Deep Learning
3. Unsupervised Learning
4. Solving Data Science Problems
5. Software Engineering for Data Scientists (No assocaited project)
6. Data Engineering for Data Scientists
7. Experimental Design and Recommendation Systems
8. Capstone Project

Hence, I have broken up the files numerically according to this order.

Learning Material Files:
* Lecture notes as GIMP xcf files
* Folders containing code implementations

Project Files:
* (More information to come)
