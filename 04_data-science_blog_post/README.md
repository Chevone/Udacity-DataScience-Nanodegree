# Data Science Nanodegree Project 4: Write a Data Science Blogpost

Author: Simon Thornewill von Essen

Start Date: 2019-05-23

## Description

During the lessons for this project, we analysed the "Stack Overflow Dev. Survey 2017" for insights about how to enter the job market and analysed 
various effects of variables upon salary and job satisfaction.

I would like to do further analysis on this dataset becuase I found it very interesting and compelling.

## Repo Layout

This repository will have 3 sub-directories.

* dat
* python
* blog

The dat folder will contain any data used for this analysis, raw or otherwise, stored as CSV files. The python folder will contain a Jupyter notebook of 
the the analysis as well as an HTML version for quick and easy viewing without needing to spin up Jupyter. Finally, when the findings of this analysis 
need to be communicated, a copy of the draft will be found in the blog directory as a markdown file as well as images or any other relevant files.
